    "What is concept inverse of a matrix? Like numbers, matrices do have reciprocals. In case of matrices, this reciprocal is called **inverse matrix**. If A is a **square** matrix and B is its inverse, then the product of two matrices is equal to the unit matrix. \n",
    "> DEFINITION The matrix *A* is **invertible** if there exists a matrix $A^{-1}$ that \"inverts\" *A*:  \n",
    ">            Two-sided inverse $AA^{-1} = I$ and  $A^{-1}A = I$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not all matrices have inverse**, Here are four \"notes\" about $A^{-1}$.\n",
    "- Note 1: The inverse exists if and only if elimination produces *n* pivots (only row changes are allowed)\n",
    "- Note 2: If *A* is invertible, the one and only solution to *Ax = b* is *$x = A^{-1}b$* \n",
    "  > Mutiply *Ax=b* by $A^{-1}$. Then *$x = AA^{-1}b = A^{-1}b$* \n",
    "- Note 3:(Important) Suppose there is a nonzero vector $x$ such that *AX = 0*, then *A* cannot have an inverse. No matrix can bring 0 back *x*.\n",
    "- Note 4: a diagonal matrix has inverse provided no diagonal entries are zero."
